# atom-package-elm-boilerplate

A starter Atom Package for building Atom Packages using the Elm programming language.

The start building a Package from this one, clone this repo to your computer, enter the
repo directory, and enter:

`apm link --dev`

This installs the current directory in Atom as a "local package". The `--dev` option means
that it will only show up in "Dev Mode"

If you then start Atom with `atom --dev` or use `View > Developer > Open In Dev Mode..`
this work-in-progress package will be available to you.

If you want to see changes you've made while you're working on the package,
do `View > Developer > Reload Window..` or hit `control option command l` (OSX).
You'll be wanting to do this a lot, so it's worth learning this key combo.
